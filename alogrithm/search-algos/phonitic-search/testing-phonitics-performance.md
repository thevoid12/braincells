1. Accuracy, Precision, and Recall:

Soundex: This algorithm is known for its high recall, meaning it retrieves a broad set of potential matches, including many correct ones. However, this broad retrieval often comes at the cost of lower precision due to a higher number of false positives. ​

Refined Soundex: Designed to improve upon Soundex, Refined Soundex offers a more detailed encoding by representing vowels and encoding the first letter twice (as both the letter and its code). This results in different groupings compared to Soundex, potentially affecting both precision and recall. ​

Metaphone and Double Metaphone: These algorithms provide a balance between precision and recall. Metaphone has been observed to perform well with English dictionary words, while Double Metaphone introduces improvements by considering linguistic nuances from various languages, enhancing accuracy in diverse datasets. ​
