eg:
HERMAN" will code to "H06505" which will then reduce to "H655" in the last step.

- remember that no phonitic algorithm is perfect. its constantly evolving and needs to be modifed based 
on the area
- this they have a large false positive


# Refined Soundex algorithm:
- added more number of groups which is a refined version of soundex algorithm
