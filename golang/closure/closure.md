# closure
- closure is very common among many programming languages 
- it gets tricky if its not understood properly
- here is my closure implementations in golang

sample example:
- [1.simple example](./example-1/main.go)
- [2.example with arguments](./example-2/main.go)
- [3.mutable closure and gc](./example-3/main.go)
- [4.real example](./example-4/main.go)



- Scope is static, based on the code at compile time
- Lifetime depends on program execution (runtime)
