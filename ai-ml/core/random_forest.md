# regression vs classification
- Regression = Predicting quantities (real numbers) which we call continuous variable, not categories.
- based on some input we predict some real numbers as output.
- some example of regression: 
  - Predicting the price of a house based on area, location, number of rooms, etc.
  - Estimating the temperature for tomorrow given weather conditions.
  - Forecasting sales revenue based on ad spend and past performance.
- classification is like Classification	Predict email is spam or not, dress size is s,m or l etc
- Classification â†’ Output is categorical (like a label). soimetimes categorical can also be numbers like a zipcode. so depends on the context
- some common regression algo are: 
    - linear regression
    - decision trees/ random forest regressor
    - gradient boosting (xgboost,lightGBM)
    - support vector regression etc etc
