- if it is a subarray most probably it involes fixed length or variable length sliding window
- if it is a sorted array and tc is less it is mostly binary search
- if you get a dice problem utilize that the numbers are from 1 to 6 so mostly the loop over the number is negligible as we are just iterating 6 numbers
