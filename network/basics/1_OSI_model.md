# OSI model
- open system interconnection model
## why does osi model exists
- The OSI model (Open Systems Interconnection model) exists because the early days of networking were chaotic every vendor had their own proprietary protocols, hardware, and systems that did not interoperate well. The OSI model was introduced to standardize communication between different systems
- In the 1970s and early 1980s, networking was vendor-specific. For example, IBM systems couldn't talk to DEC systems. The OSI model was created by the ISO (International Organization for Standardization) to ensure that different systems could communicate using common standards.
- The OSI model breaks networking into seven logical layers, where each layer has a defined role:

    - This separation makes networks easier to design, implement, and troubleshoot.

    - Changes in one layer (e.g., physical medium) donâ€™t affect others (e.g., the application protocol).
- The OSI model serves as a universal reference model, not tied to any specific technology or vendor. This was meant to help Protocol developers,
Hardware vendors, Software engineers speak a common language when designing systems.
